        "\n",
        "The UK Regional Resilience audit is a research focused analytical framework designed to investigate the structural decoupling between economic growth and public well being. Traditional economic metrics, such as headline Gross Value Added (GVA) or Gross Domestic Product (GDP), often obscure localised pressures, institutional friction, that prevent economic prosperity from translating into improved standards of living. By combining longitudinal administrative data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) with real-time regional news sentiment via web scraping, this study identifies areas of economic expansion  which outgrow social infrastructure resilience. Such a study is deemed important by 10 Downing Street (10DS) who have the aim of the UK sustaining G7 growth lead by 2030 (HMG, 2025)."

        "## Background (understanding of regional resilience)\n",
        "\n",
        "From a research standpoint, regional resilience literature is defined as a metropolitan area's ability to maintain or reconfigure its socio-economic structures in response to exogenous (external) shocks. Recent literature has moved from a rebounding (*\"bounce back\"*) definition toward adaptive resilience (Boschma, 2015), where regions continually develop through diversity and learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "In such literature, the concept of a region's absorptive capacity is stressed, as insitutional theory argues that a region's realised absorptive capcity, i.e., the area's ability to assimilate and exploit external resources is a primary reason of whether an increase in capital investment leads to increased welfare (Royal Society, 2022). This is explored by Hanafy and Marktanner (2019), who examined Egypt and investigate how regional absorptive capacity moderates the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on economic growth across various governorates (regions). They discovered found that FDI in the service sector only translated into positive regional growth when a minimum threshold of domestic private investment was already locally present to act as a proxy for absorptive capacity. Without this institutional readiness to absorb new technologies and knowledge domains, the influx of foreign capital did not lead to the expected increases in local welfare.\n",
        "However, scaling limit is something to consider for a region's reabsorptive capacity. Numerous authors comprehend that physical and institutional scaling limits are present (Becker,Egger and von Ehrlich, 2013). This is where  where rapid economic influxes without corresponding infrastructure scaling result in diminished returns(aka, \"*extractive growth*\").\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that some understanding of regional resilience has been established, the UK context also confirms the understanding above. The research stipulates that increases in research and development (R&D) investment will only succeed if regions have a sufficient volume of appropriately skilled labour pools to absorb funding effectively (Royal Society, 2022). A direct link between economic prosperity and high areas of \"absorptive capacity\" roles (occupations in technical and scientific sectors) is present where thriving regions like London and the South East show significant internal variation in their ability to exploit new knowledge.\n",
        "Although, the Productivity Institute (2025) explicitly identifies that inadequate transport and digital infrastructure, looking at the Midlands,constrain economic mobility and act as significant barriers to productivity growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at other regions, an investment versus skills gap is seen present showcasing a dual-reality innovation landscape. The Productivity Institute (2025) reports that the region saw a significant increase in UKRI investment, totaling an absolute rise of £171 million between 2021/22 and 2023/24 Despite this investment, approximately one-third of vacancies that employers find difficult to fill are attributed to a lack of digital skills.\n",
        "A productivity gap is further observed in the North West region of England.productivity was approximately 90.6% of the UK average in 2019. The GVA per hour growth rate fell from 0.9% (2005–2010) to just 0.2% per annum (2010–2018).\n",
        "Nonetheless, the North West of England has stagnation, this is despite the fact that the region maintains over 37,800 workplaces in professional, scientific, and technical sectors, representing a significant latent capacity for R&D absorption (Department for Business and Trade, 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "Indeed, the The UK government has explicitly placed significant emphasis on addressing regional disparities and fostering prosperity through its '*Levelling Up*' agenda. This agenda aims to reduce geographical inequalities across the UK, moving beyond traditional economic growth metrics to focus on a broader range of outcomes that impact people's lives. Key areas the government intends to solve include improving living standards, enhancing local leadership, boosting productivity, and increasing opportunities in areas that have historically lagged behind.\n",
        "This directly aligns with the concept of regional resilience by seeking to improve the capacity of all regions to adapt, thrive, and contribute to national prosperity (HM Government, 2022).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The literature above depicts a nuanced perspective on regional resilience, absorptive capacity and growth in regions and its association with local welfare. ***The question is posed to understand these associations and discrepancies arising within the UK as seen in the paragraph above.***\n"

        "# Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at regional resilience and its absorptive capacity in respect to capital investment and welfare certain datasets and libraries (dependcies) are used to investigate this audit. The datasets used are from 2 sources, ONS and BBC News.\n",
        "\n",
        "ONS, used estimates here for regional economic well being under the measure GVA, GVA per head and population statistics. Using ONS regional data allows balanced panel data spanning over 18 years with over 222,000 data points. This makes such a dataset have a valid and complete dataset having data present on each individual regions and industries. Additionally, the study segregates the data into hierarchical UK geographical classifications of ITL1 and ITL2 used for statistics where ITL 1 represents large regions (like England's nine regions or Scotland as one) and ITL 2 divides these into smaller areas like groups of counties or combined authorities (ONS, 2024). ITL2 is designed for comparable international data by balancing population sizes across regional levels.\n",
        "Furthermore, GVA allows more international comparative metrics like GVA per head which is more useful as cross-country study but also acknowledges limitations of using such measures like not factoring in commuters to metropolitan locations like London.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using BBC news for real-time narrative data is becoming more popular. This technique of using near real-time allows researchers to bridge the gap that annual dataset economic reporting can miss. Headlines from contemporary news can act as proxies to understanding and driving behaviours like economic purchasing as well as being able to '*snapshot*' the public mood at a particular point in time (Baker, Bloom and Davis, 2016). In this EDA, a combination of the web scraping and sentiment polarity libraries are used to extract and be process via a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to assing polarity scores ranging from -1 (deemed negative) to 1 (positive) (Al-Omari and Hudaib, 2020).\n",
        "\n",
        "The reader may wonder on the usage of these metrics and sources (particulary the BBC news sentiment datasource) and its relation to regional resilience. Bristow and Healy (2014) state that such datasets encompass economic activity and resilience, sentiment more importantly has been understood to be tied to the lifecycle of economic resilience (resistance, recovery and renewal). News sentiment additionally can help be a leading indicator for exogenous shocks (e.g., mass unemployment) and such sentiment will be present a considerably longer period before official national publications cite similar outcomes (Hansen, McMahon and Neuhann, 2020). Such news sentiment can influence behaviour leading to s spread of economic impact. Conversely, where negative stories about cost of living cause consumers to postpone spending, directly affecting local growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "By overlaying high-velocity sentiment scores with structural GVA per head, the methodology identifies regions suffering from economic growth measures. If a region shows high GVA growth but persistently negative sentiment headlines, it indicates a lack of adaptive resilience, where economic gains are being diluted by infrastructure strain or service failures."

        "Finally, for the ONS dataset, the cleaned GVA and Population Polars DataFrames also contains annual GVA and Population growth rate change. This is understood as the change difference/original value, and selects the latest available growth rates. In these dataframes, polars is used as opposed to an original pandas dataframes. Polars executes faster across joins, filters, and aggregations by using parallelism (Databricks, 2025). Polars uses less RAM (random access memory, used to store data and machine code) because of its Arrow-style columnar storage and integrates more broadly with Python tools (Hynkova, 2025). *The polars dataframe uses only the latest year*."

        "Now that the dataframes (DF) have been merged with both data. A '*Prosperity_Delta*' calculating the the difference between 'GVA_Growth_Rate' and '*Population_Growth_Rate*' is needed. This is calculated due to exhibiting a more refined measure of economic well-being other than gross economic output alone (Costanza, De Groot, Sutton, Van der Ploeg, Anderson, Kubiszewski, Farber and Turner, 2014). The metric is rooted in the understanding that economic growth must be considered in relation to population parameter to accurately reflect ***per capita*** growth. A high GVA growth rate might be offset by a proportionate rise in population growth rates thus masking resource availability (Costanza *et al.*, 2014).\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, a '*Friction Score*' measure is used to address the economic dimensions that GVA/ GVA per head and offers a more holistic understanding of well being. The measure is calculated by: GVA_per_Head/Sentiment_Score and is interpreted as a higher value means significant disconnect (aka, friction) arising between a regions output and percieved well being of a population (OECD, 2020). This can be used as a signal to understand structural decopuing which this notebook intends to explore. A high value could be the direct indicator of decoupling where a region is productive economically but has dissatisfaction which could arise from factors like insufficient infrastructure resources or poor quality of life (Leng, Jiang and Liu, 2020).\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of a friction score is introduced for three key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "i) *Theoretical bridging:* The measure integrates '*real time*' public sentiment (derived from news headlines) as a proxy for non-economic factors which may influence public well being and adaptive resilience (Hansen *et al.*, 2019).\n",
        "\n",
        "ii) *Quantifying decoupling:* The core  research problem this metric intends to solve is the identification of regions where economic growth is not matched by a corresponding positive public sentiment (Rodríguez-Pose, 2018). If a region exhibits a high GVA per head but a lower (or negative) sentiment score  (indicating public dissatisfaction or concern), the resulting '*Friction Score*' will be high signalling potential public disconnect (Rodríguez-Pose, 2018).\n",
        "\n",
        "iii) *Adaptive resilience proxy:* Mentioned earlier, regional resilience is not just about rebounding but also about '*adaptive resilience*'(the region's capacity to assimilate and exploit external resources).The friction score acts as an indicator of this adaptive capacity (Forlani and Lubian, 2020). A high score suggests that despite economic inputs, there's a struggle in translating these into perceived well-being, implying a lower absorptive capacity or significant institutional and/or infrastructural bottlenecks (Forlani and Lubian, 2020).\n",

        "For '*Prosperity_Delta*' figures, the descriptive statistics the count of 391  matches the total number of Local Authorities in the df_final DataFrame. The null_count of 0.0 confirms that '*Prosperity_Delta*' was successfully calculated for all entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean average for '*Prosperity_Delta*' suggests the GVA growth rate is approximately 2.435% higher than the population growth rate across the regions. This indicates that overall economic activity is slightly outpacing population expansion on a per-capita basis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard deviation of about 0.0226 suggests a moderate spread in '*Prosperity_Delta*' values. This means there's a noticeable variation in how well GVA growth is translating into per-capita prosperity across different regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, the lowest (min) '*Prosperity_Delta*' observed is approximately -6.38%. This indicates at least one region where population growth significantly outstrips GVA growth, potentially signaling declining per-capita resources or economic stress.\n",
        "\n",
        "The highest (max) '*Prosperity_Delta*' is approximately 13.67%, representing a region where GVA growth significantly surpasses population growth, indicating strong per-capita economic gains.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For '*Friction_Score*' values, the count states there are 391 valid entries for 'Friction_Score', corresponding to all Local Authorities. Crucially, the null_count is 0.0, indicating that the re-merging with the expanded sentiment data and subsequent recalculation successfully eliminated all prior null values, thus providing a complete dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "The average '*Friction_Score*' is approximately 2.2 million. This gives a general idea of the magnitude of decoupling, though the wide range suggests significant variability.\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard deviation is also extremely high, approximately 10.7 million. This large value relative to the mean indicates a highly skewed distribution and extreme variability in '*Friction_Score*' values across regions. This suggests the presence of outliers, where some regions exhibit exceptionally high friction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lowest '*Friction_Score*' is approximately 297,872. This indicates regions where GVA per head is relatively well-aligned with public sentiment (low friction).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the maximum '*Friction_Score*' is a staggering 211 million. This extreme value confirms the presence of significant outliers and indicates regions where the economic output per head is vastly disproportionate to the public sentiment. This represents the most acute cases of structural decoupling observed in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, looking at both measures reveals a diverse landscape of economic prosperity and public sentiment alignment across UK regions. Whilst '*Prosperity_Delta*' generally shows positive per capita growth, the '*Friction_Score*' highlights significant disparities, with a few regions exhibiting extreme levels of decoupling, warranting further investigation into their specific circumstances."

        "The y-axis, representing the Friction_Score, clearly shows the scale of this decoupling. For example, the region with the highest bar demonstrates an exceptionally high Friction_Score, potentially in the millions. This visually reinforces the statistical observation of a highly skewed distribution with significant outliers. By comparing the heights of the bars, the reader can quickly grasp the relative extent of decoupling across different LAs.

        "The heatmap visually condenses a complex multi-dimensional dataset into an easily interpretable format, effectively highlighting London as a region with high economic activity but also the most significant '*friction*', suggesting a profound structural decoupling. London's high friction score of 8.0780e6 is vastly higher than any other region. This is driven by its exceptionally high Avg_GVA_per_Head (200129.69697) being divided by a relatively negative Avg_Sentiment_Score (-0.024775). This suggests that despite its immense economic prosperity, London faces considerable 'friction', indicating that economic gains are not fully translating into widespread public satisfaction or that the high cost of living and infrastructure strain are heavily impacting sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other regions also show varying degrees of friction. For example, the North East, despite having a positive sentiment, still has a substantial Friction_Score (1.8548e6), driven by its GVA per head. The East of England has a lower Friction_Score (669421.143811) compared to London, but this is influenced by both a lower GVA per head and a more negative sentiment. The heatmap allows us to see these relative differences at a glance."

        "This scatter mapbox plot is an effective tool for visualising two key aspects of regional dynamics: Avg_GVA_per_Head, which are represented by the color of the markers, and the Avg_Population_Growth_Rate (represented by the size of the markers). Each marker on the map corresponds to a specific UK region, allowing for a geographical understanding of these metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at the scatter mapbox, the most striking feature of the map is undoubtedly the marker for London. This stands out as significantly larger and coloured with the brightest colour (indicating the highest Avg_GVA_per_Head) and confirms London's exceptional economic productivity and its robust population growth. The sheer scale of London's economic output and its continuous demographic expansion clearly position it as a unique economic pole within the UK (Swales, 2020).\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond London, the map reveals a gradient of Avg_GVA_per_Head across other regions. Generally, regions in the South of England, such as the South East and East of England, exhibit brighter colors, suggesting higher economic productivity per person. In contrast, regions in the North (North East, North West, Yorkshire and The Humber) display cooler or darker colors, indicating lower Avg_GVA_per_Head. This visually reinforces the well documented North-South economic divides within the UK (e.g., Bristow and Healy, 2018).\n",
        "\n",
        "The size of the markers provides insight into where population growth is most active. While London is a major growth center, ***other regions also show significant population growth***. For example, some regions in the South and East of England might also have relatively large markers, indicating substantial population increases. Conversely, some regions, particularly those with lower Avg_GVA_per_Head, might exhibit smaller markers, suggesting slower population growth or even stagnation.\n",
        "\n",
        "What stands out from looking at this map is a High GVA per Head and High Population Growth correlation. London is the prime example, illustrating an area attracting both economic activity and people.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although, some economically productive regions might have smaller markers, indicating that their economic growth is not necessarily accompanied by rapid population expansion. Regions with lower Avg_GVA_per_Head can still experience different population dynamics—some might be growing slowly, while others might be more stagnant (McCann, 2019).\n",
        "\n",
        "This interaction is crucial for understanding the Prosperity_Delta metric, as a region's economic health is not solely about GVA but also about how that GVA grows relative to its population.\n",

        "The map helps in identifying potential geographical clusters. For instance, the clustering of regions with similar colour and size characteristics might indicate shared economic or demographic trends within certain geographical areas (e.g., the concentration of certain types of economic activity or demographic shifts in coastal versus inland regions). This does not account for variance within the regions themselves that is present.\n",

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This EDA notebook embarkd on an audit of UK regional resilience, aiming to investigate the structural decoupling between economic growth and public well-being. The central question posed is to basically understand the associations and discrepancies arising within UK regions where economic prosperity might not translate into improved standards of living, particularly in the context of absorptive capacity and infrastructure scaling limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook involves the integration of diverse datasets: longitudinal economic data examining GVA, population, GVA per head from the ONS and real-time news sentiment data scraped from BBC regional RSS feeds. This multi-source approach allowed for the calculation of two novel metrics critical to addressing the research question: `Prosperity_Delta` and `Friction_Score`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key findings were as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "i) The `Prosperity_Delta` (GVA Growth Rate - Population Growth Rate) provides a refined measure of economic expansion per capita. Descriptive statistics showed that, on average, GVA growth slightly outpaced population growth across UK regions, indicating a general trend towards increasing per-capita prosperity.\n",
        "However, a significant standard deviation and a wide range (from -6.38% to 13.67%) highlighted considerable heterogeneity, with some regions experiencing a dilution of economic prosperity due to higher population growth, while others demonstrated robust per-capita growth. ***This directly addresses the first part of the question by showing the varied success in translating overall economic growth into individual-level gain***s.\n",
        "\n",
        "ii) `Friction_Score` (GVA per Head / Sentiment Score) is deemed the primary metric for identifying and quantifying the structural decoupling. This score explicitly measures the disconnect between a region's economic output and its perceived well-being, as captured by news sentiment.\n",
        "The descriptive statistics for `Friction_Score` were particularly revealing: while the average score was substantial, an extremely high standard deviation and a maximum value of 211 million underscored the presence of significant outliers. This confirms that the problem of decoupling is not uniformly distributed but is acutely concentrated in certain areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "iii) The '*Top Regions by Friction Score*' bar chart visually reinforced this finding, clearly identifying specific Local Authorities where `Friction_Score` values were exceptionally high. These regions are prime examples of the core problem identified in the research question: areas where economic activity, despite its magnitude, is failing to translate into a corresponding positive public sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "This was further explored in the interactive map further contextualised these findings geographically, particularly highlighting London's unique position of both immense economic productivity and significant '*friction*'.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this notebook demonstrates that while economic prosperity, as measured by GVA, is present across UK regions, its translation into improved well-being is highly uneven. The `Friction_Score` acts as a crucial indicator of a region's adaptive resilience and absorptive capacity; a high score suggests that despite economic inputs, there's a struggle in translating these into perceived well-being, implying lower absorptive capacity or significant institutional/infrastructural bottlenecks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This directly addresses the overarching research question by providing a robust framework and empirical evidence for identifying regions where economic growth is structurally decoupled from public sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, the study indicates areas requiring targeted policy interventions beyond traditional economic stimuli to foster genuine regional resilience and well-being."
